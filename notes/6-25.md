"Applying" TypeScript to Angular:

## Instructions

**I Will Walk You Through This, Don't Work Ahead, Please**

- Install `date-fns`
- pull my src/features and src/app
  - I'll try this first.
  - ```sh
    cd src
    npx gitpick JeffryGonzalez/typescript-for-ng-june-2025/tree/tuesday-night/src/features
    npx gitpick JeffryGonzalez/typescript-for-ng-june-2025/tree/tuesday-night/src/mocks -o
    ```
  - Add the rout in `app.routes.ts`
  - Create a link in the navbar
  - Feature List:
    - dashboard (`/customers`) (`home.ts`)
      - should show some stats
      - should show a loading status until the customers are loaded.
    - on /list
      - the add to call list should do something
        - save prefs in local storage
      - Customers that have never been contacted should be indicated
      - Customers that haven't been contacted in < 2 months should be indicated
      - The sort buttons should do something
    - on /add
      - The form should do something.
    - on /calls
      - This should show a "call list" of all the folks that have been added to the call list.
      - Each should have a button for
        - Successful call (removes them from the list)
        - Tried but didn't get through or left a message (leaves them on the list, but it is indicated)
